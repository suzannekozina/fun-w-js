    <p> JavaScript's built-in constructor called, "Object" is already defined by the JavaScript language and can make an object without any properties or methods. After the object has been created you can add properties to it through dot notation.<br>
    <i>To see the JavaScript, open dev tools (SHIFT+CTL+I) and click on the HTML file under the "Source" tab. Click on the "Console" tab to see the console output.  </p>
  
    <script>
    var leif = new Object();
    leif.name = "Leif Eriksson ";
    leif.age = 2000;
    
    console.log(leif.name)
    console.log(leif.age)
